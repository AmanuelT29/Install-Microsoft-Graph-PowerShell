# Install Microsoft Graph PowerShell

## Platform and Tools Used


## Objective

In this project, I will demonstrate how to install Microsoft Graph PowerShell. Microsoft Graph PowerShell is the official toolset to manage Entra ID (Azure AD) using PowerShell. It replaces older modules like AzureAD and gives you secure, scriptable access to identity, group, roles, policies, and more via Microsoft Graph API. It allows us to automate, manage, and interact with Entra ID using simple command-line instructions.
